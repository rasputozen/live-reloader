# Basic Usage: #
Pretty simple... enter the path to the python scripts you want to have the .pyc files removed before each reload of Live.  There are two inputs for this in case you're working with two scripts at a time.
In the last input box specify the path to Live.exe (or w/e the .exe is called, if you're on Windows 7 or 8 the default is probably correct)

## Hotkeys: ##

- Ctrl + Alt + ; (semicolon)
	- Load Live (or reload it if it's already open)
- Ctrl + Alt + l (L)
	- Close Live
- Ctrl + Alt + 8
	- Open GUI (to change script path directories for cleanup)

### Compatibility: ###
I don't know if this works on anything except windows 7. This was coded in AHK v1.1.13.01

### Feautures To Add: ###
- Hotkey to open/close/reload log file
- Customizable hotkeys
