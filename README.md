Basic Usage:
	Pretty simple... enter the path to the python scripts you want to have the .pyc files removed before each reload of Live.  There are two inputs for this in case you're working with two scripts at a time. (not yet implemented, but probably will by tomorrow)
	In the last input box specify the path to Live.exe (or w/e it's called, if you're on Windows 7 or 8 the default is probably correct)

Hotkeys:
Ctrl + Alt + 9
- Load Live (or reload it if it's already open)
Ctrl + Alt + ;
- Close Live
Ctrl + Alt + 8
- Open GUI (to change script path directories for cleanup)
